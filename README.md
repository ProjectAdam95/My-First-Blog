##  :beginner: About
- This webpage acts as a blog where the user can share their thoughts. The page requests the user to enter information via a form.
- Then the user is asked to put in their username or name, title for the post and the content they would like to share.
- After submitting the user is taken to the blog page where they can view their post and also the 5 most recent posts displayed in the center of the screen.
- On the form page the user is given the choice of altering the theme from a dark/light mode to suit their preference.
- If the user wishes to enter another post they may click the Back button to navigate back to the home page.
- If the user viewing the page wishes to view additional projects by me, a link to my portfolio is at the bottom of the home page and blog page!
  

Features include:
- Landing page where the user is prompted to enter a form with inputs for Username, Title and Content the user would like to share.
- Error message if the user does not enter anything in the input fields.
